Gen-AI Enabled Integrated Platform Environment (IPE) Architecture Document
1. Overview
The Gen-AI Enabled Integrated Platform Environment (IPE) is a one-stop solution for platform support teams, integrating AI-driven automation, contextual recommendations, and enterprise knowledge retrieval to enhance troubleshooting and incident resolution capabilities.
2. Objectives
•	Reduce context switching for platform support teams.
•	Provide an integrated console for seamless troubleshooting.
•	Leverage AI chatbot and automation for incident resolution.
•	Enable proactive recommendations based on telemetry and historical incidents.
•	Integrate with enterprise data sources via MCP (Model Context Protocol).
•	Extract context-based data such as dependencies and connectivity information.
3. High-Level Architecture
3.1 Architecture Diagram
The architecture consists of multiple components structured into logical layers:
•	Presentation Layer (Frontend UI)
•	Application Layer (AI Services & Automation)
•	Data Layer (Enterprise Integrations & Storage)
(Architecture Diagram Placeholder - Will be added separately)
4. System Components
4.1 Integrated Console (Frontend UI)
•	Web-based dashboard for L1/L2/L3 platform support teams.
•	Provides role-based access and interactive widgets.
•	Embedded AI chatbot for real-time assistance.
•	Incident management interface with automation triggers.
4.2 AI Chatbot (GPT Backend)
•	Context-aware chatbot powered by OpenAI API.
•	Assists with troubleshooting, incident analysis, and RCA summaries.
•	Can fetch logs, KB articles, and configuration details.
•	Provides natural language search capabilities for CI details.
4.3 Agentic Capabilities for Incident Resolution
•	Trigger automated Ansible scripts for fixes.
•	Run system health checks and fetch diagnostics.
•	Integrates with ServiceNow/JIRA for incident tracking.
•	Supports multi-modal user interactions (voice, text, command-based).
4.4 Contextual Recommendations Engine
•	Machine learning-driven suggestions based on logs, telemetry, and past incidents.
•	Fetches similar incidents and correlates resolution steps.
•	Uses NLP and data clustering techniques for pattern recognition.
4.5 Enterprise Data Integration via MCP
•	Connects to enterprise knowledge bases, CMDB, logs, and monitoring tools.
•	Provides API-based access to Datadog, Prometheus, Splunk, and more.
•	Enables federated search across enterprise data repositories.
4.6 Context-Based Data Extraction Module
•	Extracts CI relationships, dependencies, and health status.
•	Provides insights into connectivity and upstream/downstream impact.
•	Uses LangChain-powered contextual search for querying structured/unstructured data.
5. Technology Stack
•	Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Next.js
•	Backend: FastAPI/Flask, Python
•	AI/ML: OpenAI API, LangChain, Hugging Face, Scikit-learn
•	Automation: Ansible, Python-based scripting
•	Database: PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch
•	Enterprise Integrations: REST APIs, Webhooks, MCP-based adapters
•	Monitoring & Logging: Prometheus, Grafana, Splunk
6. Scalability & Performance Considerations
•	Microservices-based architecture for modular design.
•	Event-driven processing using Kafka/RabbitMQ.
•	Asynchronous task execution for improved response times.
•	Containerization with Kubernetes for scalability.
•	Security-first approach with role-based access control and API gateways.
7. Deployment & Integration Strategy
•	MVP Phase: Core functionalities with chatbot and automation.
•	Phase 2: Expand AI recommendations and telemetry correlation.
•	Phase 3: Advanced contextual data extraction and multi-modal interactions.
•	Deployment: Dockerized services deployed on AWS/GCP/Azure.
8. Conclusion
The Gen-AI Enabled IPE streamlines platform support workflows by integrating AI-powered automation, contextual recommendations, and enterprise knowledge retrieval into a single, efficient interface.
